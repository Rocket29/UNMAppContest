public class ArrayBuilderForAdresses {
    /*TODO: add an address array builder so that it can be passed into the district builders that way the hard coding is actually not that hard
    This is the class that will access the SQL database.
    Each time an array is built it will be passed in with certain parameters which the class will then look for in the SQL database.
    After the array has been built it will return an array with the speified parapmeters which will then be plugged into
    the district classes.
    The idea is that this class can crate arrays for the different districts.
    By using the array builder it would cut down on the need to have multiple calls to the SQL database, and uses
    this class as the interface between the user I/O class and the database.
