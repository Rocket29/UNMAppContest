Concept:
The object of this app is to provide the user with all of the data they would need when participating in an election. 
This would include the different kinds of districts (school, voting, etc.) along with which elections are taking place within the district and who is running, what 
and issues and resolutions are up for vote. The user would simply input their address, and the application would return all of the data they would need when going 
to the voting booth. 


Stage One:
Stage one of the application's development is a simple user address input with a list of the district in which the address is located. This stage includes 
a basic GUI, an in-app data base for the districts, and an understandable user Input/Output. During this stage the main focus will be the idea of the app,
and testing the logic of comparing the user input to a series of districts. This focus of this stage will be to test the logic and I/O of the app. In 
stage we are only supporting one address for testing purposes. 

Stage Two:
Stage two will focus on user compatibility. An emphasis will be put on the GUI, assuming the logic and base code is working. In addition to a more robust GUI, 
this stage will include the implementation of Elections into the districts, along with each of the Issues within the district. This phase will also include
a massive data collection and input into a database, most likely stored within the application package, as a text file. The focus of this stage will be 
making the GUI easy to use and good looking, along with supporting more addresses within the app. During this stage we will work to support all of Voting 
District Three. 

Stage Three:
Stage three will be the implementation of a user profile, along with the storage of address, issue, and election data stored in an SQL file. The goal of 
the user profile will be to allow the user to put in different demographics which elections and issues may affect, and then compare that profile to the 
Issues and Elections. Furthermore, stage three will include the implementation of Candidates, allowing for users to see who is running in Elections.
We hope to finish this stage by the end of the application contest. During this stage we will work to include all of New Mexico

Stage Four:
Stage four will focus on making the SQL database server based, along with incorporating a social aspect to the app. By moving the SQL database to a server 
it will bring down the size of the app, allowing it to take up less space on the user's device, along with allowing the application to run faster, and 
support more data and Districts. Furthermore, it will allow us to run a data gathering program to allow the address assignment to be automated. 
The social aspect of the app will allow users to find groups that support their interests which are active in the user's area. There may be other
aspects of the social interaction, but that will involve more application development and research. 
During this stage we will work to include a majority of the U.S.


What is in the package you have received:
- ArrayBuilderForAddresses.java
- Elections.java
- Issues.java
- SchoolDistrict.java
- UserInputAndOutput.jva
- Util.Java
- VoterProfile.java
- VotingDistrict.java

Current Operating Program:
Our current program supports one address, one school district, and one voting district. Take note of the above-mentioned development stages.


Next Steps: 
Our next goal is to produce and functioning GUI, along with support for addresses in and around the UNM main campus area.
